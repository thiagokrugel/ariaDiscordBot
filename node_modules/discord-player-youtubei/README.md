# Discord Player YouTubei

This is a preview the v7 version of the YouTube system that discord-player will be using made backwards compatiable with v6.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install discord-player-youtubei
# ----------- or -----------
$ yarn add discord-player-youtubei
```

## Usage

#### Typescript and ESM

```ts
import { YoutubeiExtractor } from "discord-player-youtubei"

const player = useMainPlayer() // or new Player()

player.extractors.register(YoutubeiExtractor, {})
```

#### CommonJS

```ts
const { YoutubeiExtractor } = require("discord-player-youtubei")

const player = useMainPlayer() // or new Player()

player.extractors.register(YoutubeiExtractor, {})
```

*I have seen many people registering the extractor in their commands. DO NOT DO THIS*

## How Discord Player Youtubei handles bridging

As of `1.2.1`, discord-player-youtubei will detect if you are signed in or not and will use YouTube music streaming system. If this is not available, the extractor will use normal YouTube.

You can override this behavior using the `overrideBridgeMode` option. See the extractor options below for more information regarding the types

## Signing into YouTube

First run the following command
```bash
$ npx --no discord-player-youtubei
```

The token will be printed out shortly

*In case of errors, you can directly run the `generateOauthTokens` function exported by discord-player-youtubei*

```ts
import { YoutubeiExtractor } from "discord-player-youtubei"

const player = useMainPlayer()
/**
 * getOauthTokens is not a real function exported by discord-player-youtubei.
 * It is simply a placeholder for the actual oauth tokens
 * 
 * Do not just put in access token. Put in the entire string.
 */
const oauthTokens = getOauthTokens() // The tokens printed from step above

player.extractors.register(YoutubeiExtractor, {
    authentication: oauthTokens
})
```
